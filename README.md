# MAST5112 - Example - Using Fonts

A simple program that uses different fonts in the App instead of the phone standard

## Instructions

We used the following blog post as a guide to install and use fonts. 
https://blog.logrocket.com/adding-custom-fonts-react-native/

Please do your own homework for the fonts (from Google Fonts) you would like to use for the headings and the normal text. 

Download the font family/zip files. Extract the contents of the zip files into your project directory - inside assets > inside fonts. 

Following the instructions in the blog post. Create a new react-native.config.js file. Copy the contents as required and execute the command "npx react-native-asset". After installing the dependency, you are then required to use the fonts in the styles variable using the "fontFamily" attribute in the code.
